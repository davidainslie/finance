This project contains code used to analyze financial data.

To build and run the finance.scala app:

1) Install scala (brew install scall works)
2) scalac finance.scala ; scala Main

This will show you a demo of S&P 500 performance, comparing arithmetic mean and geometric mean, and then compare it to an EIUL.
